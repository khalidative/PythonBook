Begin with the tools that you are most comfortable with. 
It is important to keep the friction low when you are just starting out.
Your emerging needs will inform your specific tooling decisions so just start creating instead of getting stuck at planning.
I tried Workflowy and Notion.so for writing. Settled on StackEdit.io for its Markdown support, cloud syncing and offline editing capabilities. It was a good enough choice but can fall short when gathering feedback on your material.
Leveraged YAML front matter to include metadata inside the text and Nunjucks templating language to be able to use conditionals and variables.
Created node.js scripts to move documents around, and to pre&post process them according to the desired output format (offline vs online).
My process was automated but not overly engineered. Remember, do things that don’t scale.
I worked with a proofreader on Fiverr
Used Leanpub to self-publish and to generate an unbranded ebook in multiple formats to be sold on the Amazon Kindle store.
This linked post by Zapier is a must-read if you are planning on self-publishing.
Used Educative.io to create an interactive and animated course out of my already existing material.
